I like to showcase design through careful choice of typography (I’m a huge fan of variable fonts and the possibilities they offer), natural photography, whitespace, and keeping clutter down to a minimum through thoughtful application architecture.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <h3>UX &amp; UI Design</h3>\n              <p>I have extensive experience in both digital and print design.

I'm not able to rely on sunrise/sunset tones to rescue my image. In addition, I am fascinated by light sources, and love the way that simple lights can illuminate a scene through shadows, reflections and diffusion.</p>\n            <p>I hope that you find something in my photos that resonates with you as it does for me.</p>\n             */}\n            {/*\n\nWork experience\n          Design skills/tools\n          Coding skills/tools\n          Photography gear\n        */}\n      </PageContainer>\n\n    </Page>\n  );\n};\n\nexport { HomeRoute };\nexport default HomeRoute;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
