This page was a company profile page which happened to have a head and shoulders picture of all 50 of their employees; and on average, each image weighed about 200kb.</p>\n          <p>50 x 200kb = <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"despair\">ðŸ˜±</span></p>\n          <p>I fired up Photoshop and bulk exported new versions of these images at a lower JPG quality (50-60%) and managed to get most images down to around 40kb. However I noticed that there were a few images that I couldnâ€™t drag below 100kb, unless I set the quality down to 10% resulting in a pixelly mess.</p>\n          <h2>Itâ€™s all in the detail</h2>\n          <p>Have a look at these two images below, the left shirt of which I am ashamed to admit that I own.</p>\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            colSpan={6}\n            items={[\n              { image: article.image },\n              { image: article.image }\n            ]}\n          />\n          <p>Which one of these 2 images do you think will result in a larger exported file size? The checked shirt. The JPG export attempts to capture all the detail in the clothing of some of those aforementioned employee profile pictures, thus significantly increasing their file size.</p>\n          <h2>The fix</h2>\n          <p>With a bit of experimentation, I found that I could use Lightroom to blur the offending item of clothing enough to not make it very noticeable, but also take the edge off the detail which brings down the file size. Take this image below of me pretending to read a book which weighs approximately 150kb.</p>\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            items={{ image: article.image }}\n            caption=\"An industrial estate local to me.
