It is an amazing place to visit as a photographer during the day and I was eager to see what I could capture at night.</p>\n          <p>It was a warm time of year with balmy evenings and a gentle breeze. There was a lot of pollution in the air which created a smoky effect around streetlights and backlit shop signs. I remember thinking that our driver must have been going crazy at the amount of times I asked him to stop in the middle of nowhere so I could take a picture.</p>\n          <p>Most imagery people see of India tend to be during the day or of famous sights. I wanted to try something different, and capture the hazy warmth of the real India. In addition, I post-processed my photos with a warm tone to aid this. I also dialed down the contrast and lifted the blacks to create a nostalgic and calm feel; a counter-weight against the chaotic nature of life in India.</p>\n          <h3>Update!</h3>\n          <p>I'm very proud to announce that this series has been featured in a photography publication called AntiVirus Gallery at <ExternalLink className=\"u-anchor u-anchor--accent u-anchor--underline\" href=\"https://antivirus.gallery/en/india/\">https://antivirus.gallery/en/india/</ExternalLink></p>\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            items={{ image: imgIndianNights01 }}\n            caption=\"The Nut Seller\"\n          />\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            items={{ image: imgIndianNights02 }}\n            caption=\"More people than there should ever reasonably be in the back of a rickshaw.\"\n          />\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            items={{ image: imgIndianNights03 }}\n            caption=\"Zombie.\"\n          />\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            items={{ image: imgIndianNights04 }}\n            caption=\"Not the police.\"\n          />\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            items={{ image: imgIndianNights05 }}\n            caption=\"Sunset over the River Yamuna - taken from a corner of the Taj Mahal.\"\n          />\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            items={{ image: imgIndianNights06 }}\n            caption=\"An Indian wedding marquee..\"\n          />\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            items={{ image: imgIndianNights07 }}\n            caption=\"There are many signs like this decorating the skylines of buildings in Indian cities.\"\n          />\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            items={{ image: imgIndianNights08 }}\n            caption=\"The smog is so thick that it volumises light like fog.\"\n          />\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            items={{ image: imgIndianNights09 }}\n            caption=\"Some shops seem to be open all hours of the night.\"\n          />\n          <ArticleImageGrid\n            items={{ image: imgIndianNights10 }}\n            caption=\"The monkeys around cities have become tame and fearless of humans.\"\n          />\n        </ArticleText>\n\n      </ArticleTemplate>\n\n    </Page>\n  );\n};\n\nexport { IndianNightsRoute };\nexport default IndianNightsRoute;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
